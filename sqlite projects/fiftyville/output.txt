161 | Ruth | 2020 | 7 | 28 | Sometime within ten minutes of the theft,
I saw the thief get into a car in the courthouse parking lot and drive away.
If you have security footage from the courthouse parking lot, you might want
to look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame.

162 | Eugene | 2020 | 7 | 28 | I don't know the thief's name, but it was
someone I recognized. Earlier this morning, before I arrived at the courthouse,
I was walking by the ATM on Fifer Street and saw the thief there withdrawing
some money.

163 | Raymond | 2020 | 7 | 28 | As the thief was leaving the courthouse, they
called someone who talked to them for less than a minute. In the call, I heard
the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville
tomorrow. The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase
the flight ticket.
